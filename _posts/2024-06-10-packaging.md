# My Experience with Joenio Marques da Costa's Debian Packaging Tutorial - Part 1

Recently, I followed Joenio Marques da Costa's tutorial on creating Debian packages for Perl libraries, and I wanted to share my experience with you. This tutorial is the first part of a series that guides you through the process step-by-step. Here's how it went:

## Introduction

Debian is a free operating system that has been developed openly since 1993. It offers a vast number of packages, making it easy to manage software on desktops, servers, and other supported platforms. Packaging software for Debian enhances the system's overall quality and is an excellent way to contribute to the community.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Installing Debian

First, I had to ensure that I was running Debian on my machine. The tutorial recommended using the testing version of Debian, but any version would do. If you need assistance installing Debian, the Debian wiki provides comprehensive guidance.

### Installing Dependencies

Next, I installed the necessary packages for Perl packaging using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install devscripts debhelper debian-policy git-buildpackage pkg-perl-tools
```

Additionally, I installed `apt-file` and updated its database to help `dh-make-perl` locate Perl libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install apt-file
sudo apt-file update
```

### Configuring Git and dh-make-perl

I configured Git with my name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Then, I set up environment variables for `dh-make-perl`:

```bash
export EMAIL=you@example.com
export DEBFULLNAME="Your Name"
```

To save these settings for future sessions, I added them to my `~/.bash_profile`.

### Initializing CPAN

I ran `cpan` to set up basic configurations, accepting the default options.

## Creating the Package for Acme::Helloworld

With the environment set up, it was time to create the package. I used `dh-make-perl` to download the upstream source and prepare the initial Debian package files:

```bash
dh-make-perl --pkg-perl --cpan Acme::Helloworld
```

This command generated a local Git repository with the necessary files.

### Adjusting Package Files

I made several adjustments to the generated package files:

- **debian/copyright**: Updated the copyright year and removed the autogenerated disclaimer.
- **debian/control**: Updated `debhelper-compat` to the latest version and adjusted the `Standards-Version` to 4.7.0. I also improved the package description.
- **debian/changelog**: Verified that the initial changelog entry was correct.

### Building the Package

I used `pbuilder` to create a clean chroot environment and build the package:

```bash
sudo pbuilder create
BUILDER=pbuilder git-pbuilder
```

After ensuring there were no build issues, I ran `lintian` to check for policy violations:

```bash
lintian -I
lintian -I --profile pkg-perl
```

## Testing the Package Installation

The final step was to test the installation of the generated `.deb` file:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ../libacme-helloworld-perl_0.01-1_all.deb
```

## Conclusion

Following this tutorial was a rewarding experience. It provided a comprehensive introduction to Debian packaging, specifically for Perl libraries. Although the tutorial focused on an example package, the steps are applicable to other projects. I look forward to continuing with Part 2, where I'll learn how to submit packages to the official Debian repositories.
